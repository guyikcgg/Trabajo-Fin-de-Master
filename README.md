# Seguridad de los Datos en Sistemas Empotrados
### by Cristian G Guerrero
## Abstract
Data security is critical in our days. Its great importance is not anymore limited to military or industrial applications. In contrast, data security is now an important issue in consumer electronics. There are several security protocols available, aimed to protect both privacy and veracity of transmitted information. Among these protocols, TLS (Transport Layer Security) is one of the most important Internet security standards. Integrating security protocols in embedded systems has an increasingly importance, due to the arising of technologies such as _SmartHome_, _SmartCity_, and briefly, an emergent paradigm known as _Internet of Things_ (IoT). This work presents the process of integration of a TLS library in an embedded system. This system is a gateway communicating a local sensor network with Amazon Web Services cloud for IoT (AWS IoT). The integration is completed with the addition of AWS IoT Device SDK to the system, making the communication effective.
