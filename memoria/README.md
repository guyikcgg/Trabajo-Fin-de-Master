# TFG-template-with-LyX

This is a template for the Final Degree Project in the [ETSIIT](http://etsiit.ugr.es/), [University of Granada](https://www.ugr.es/), using [LyX](https://www.lyx.org/). It can be modified easily so that it can be used in any work.

## Quick Start Guide
1. Add your personal data and the information about your thesis to the preamble of THESIS.lyx (open the file, then go to Document > Settings... > LaTeX Preamble). This will fill in every field on the cover.
2. Write your _abstract_ and _acknowledgements_ in the files provided in `txt` directory.
3. Write your thesis in `txt/content.lyx` file. You can split it into several files and add them to `content.lyx` afterwards.
